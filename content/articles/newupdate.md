Sad reality :(

I'm looking to update blog to [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and Https (I'm using github pages why https not enabled?). With this updates I'm expecting blog to reach new highs, I'm not sure but maybe even I start writing something in it.

PS: I hope automatic build system still works, because I don't remember build commands
