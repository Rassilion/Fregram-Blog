No it's still not the long awaited homeserver update (BTW I'm on the third (forth maybe) iteration onde homeserver updates, now I have a Terramaster NAS)

Yes it's update time, our classic triennial updates. I'm not sure what to update :) maybe new gatsby version or [nextra](https://nextra.site/)

Next.js looks controversial now but we can still use it right?
